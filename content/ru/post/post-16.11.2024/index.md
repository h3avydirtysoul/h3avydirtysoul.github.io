## Weekly Blog

The week turned out to be quite ordinary

- **Trip to my city**
    This week I went to my hometown. Helped my mom, did a lot of things around the house, and most importantly, got my military ID. Helped my nieces learn English.

- **Studying**
    I studied a lot this week, did a lot of homework.

## Reflection

Overall, it was a good week. But the next weeks will be difficult, I am looking forward to it, as the issue with work will be resolved soon.
