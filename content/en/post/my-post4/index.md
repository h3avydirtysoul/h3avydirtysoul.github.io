## Introduction to Markup Languages
- **Markup language** is a system for annotating a document in a way that is syntactically distinguishable from the text.
- The main purpose of markup languages is to separate content from its formatting.
- Examples of markup languages:
  - HTML
  - Markdown
  - LaTeX

## What is LaTeX?
- **LaTeX** (pronounced "Lay-tech") is a document preparation system.
- LaTeX is based on TeX, a system designed by Donald Knuth for scientific publishing.
- Its primary use is to create high-quality documents with complex structures, including formulas, graphs, and tables.

## Why LaTeX?
- Automates formatting for complex documents.
- Supports mathematical formulas.
- Allows flexible template customization.
- Provides consistent output across different platforms.

## Advantages of LaTeX
- Professional-quality typesetting for scientific publications.
- Powerful citation and bibliography management (e.g., **BibTeX**).
- Widely accepted by scientific journals and conferences.
- Easy integration of mathematical formulas and figures.
