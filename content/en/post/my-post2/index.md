This past week was quite eventful!

- **Football with friends**  
  I had a fun time playing football with my friends, although I ended up feeling quite exhausted afterward. I had quite a few friends in football, and there were also younger guys who played well.

- **Cinema experience**  
  I managed to catch a movie titled *9 Seconds* which was about the heroic act of a sailor. It was a touching and intense story that left a strong impression on me.

- **University classes**  
  I attended lectures on both *theory of random processes* and *French*. It's been a mix of analytical thinking and language practice, keeping my mind busy!

- **Air hockey game**  
  I had a blast playing air hockey with a friend. It was a nice break and a competitive game, which made it even more fun.

- **Self-study**  
  Throughout the week, I dedicated time to studying topics for my own development. It felt good to dive deep into different subjects.

- **Solo walk in Moscow**  
  I enjoyed a solo walk around Moscow and visited *Gorky Park*. It was a peaceful experience, a great way to reflect and recharge.

- **Dinner with friends**  
  At the end of the week, I had a relaxing time dining out with friends at a restaurant. It was a perfect way to unwind after the busy week.

Overall, it was a well-balanced week with a mix of fun, learning, and relaxation!
