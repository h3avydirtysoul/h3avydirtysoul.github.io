## Weekly Blog

The week turned out to be quite ordinary

- **Going to the cinema**
    This week I went to see the movie "Anora" with my friends. They say that this movie will be nominated for an Oscar. An interesting movie, although the ending is very strange.

- **Playing football**
    Once again we went to play football with friends. It was fun and interesting, I scored a lot of goals. I was very tired.

- **Hanging out with friends**
    Met up with friends, played board games, I especially liked playing dice and cards. At the end of the day, we almost missed the metro.

- **Studying**
    I studied a lot this week, did a lot of homework.

- **Watching movies and ceremonies**
    This week I watched the movie Night Watch and several episodes of the anime Naruto. Also this week I watched a lot of football matches, for example: Barcelona - Real, in which Barcelona won with a score of 4-0. And I also watched the Golden Ball ceremony. It was received by Rodri, a football player from Spain.

## Reflection

Overall, it was a good week. But the next weeks will be difficult, I am looking forward to it, as the issue with work will be resolved soon.
