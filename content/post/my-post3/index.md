## Weekly Blog

This week was a whirlwind of activities, and I wanted to share everything with you in this post. It was packed with exciting moments, lots of learning, and some great times with friends.

- **The Interview with Sber**
    Early in the week, I had a big moment — my interview with Sber. As someone who's diving into cybersecurity, this was an important opportunity for me. I prepared thoroughly for the interview, from studying company policies to revisiting key concepts. The interview went well, and I also completed a test assignment they gave me. It was challenging, but I’m proud of the outcome. Fingers crossed!

- **Billiards with Friends**
    After the intensity of the interview and test, it was time to unwind. Some friends and I decided to hit the billiards hall. It had been a while since we played, but it was so much fun to relax and have a few friendly matches. We joked around, made some incredible shots (and some not-so-incredible ones), and just enjoyed each other’s company. It was a much-needed break.

- **Freshmen’s Debut: A Night of Fun**
    One of the highlights of the week was definitely attending the **“Freshmen's Debut”** event. The atmosphere was energetic, with students showing off their talents and creativity. The performances were incredible — music, dance, even some comedy acts that had the whole crowd laughing. The energy was contagious, and I was thrilled to be part of such a vibrant celebration. 
    After the event, a few of us headed to a café. It was a cozy place where we could sit back, share stories, and enjoy some good food. We reminisced about the fun at the debut, joked about university life, and just took a moment to relax and enjoy each other's company.

- **A Week of Study**
    Despite all the fun, this week was also a time of intense study. My Master’s program at RUDN keeps me busy, and I spent a lot of time hitting the books. From working through complex problems to preparing for upcoming projects, there was no shortage of academic challenges. While it could be exhausting, there's a certain satisfaction in making progress, especially when the topics are as engaging as they are.

## Reflection

Looking back, this week was a great mix of work and play. I balanced my studies and professional growth with time spent with friends and new experiences. Life is all about balance, and I feel like I’ve managed to find a good rhythm this week. Here’s to more weeks like this — full of growth, challenges, and fun times with friends.
